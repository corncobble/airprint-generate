## airprint-generate.py

This script will generate avahi .service files for shared CUPS printers.

This script will connect to a CUPS server and for each printer configured and
marked as shared will generate a .service file for avahi that is compatible
with Apple's AirPrint announcements. Any printer that can be configured to work
with CUPS can be used. Printers should not be configured in CUPS as raw, unless
the printer can natively print PDF. That is to say, CUPS needs to already be
configured with a PDF filter. Debian based distributions ship CUPS pre-configured
this way.

This script can also discover networked printers via DNS-SD, independent of CUPS,
and produce exact .service files for them, allowing the printers to be announced
on different subnets by copying the .service files to /etc/avahi/services/ there.
This solves the problem of AirPrint printers not being available outside the
local subnet even though routing/NAT exists between subnets.

DNSSD has a limit of 255 Chars for a given txt-record, because of this the list
of accepted pdl's will be truncated to fit. If you're curious to see which ones
are trimmed out of the list run the script with the verbose flag (--verbose).

If python-lxml is installed, .service files will be generated in a human
readble format. I wasn't able to get minidom's version to work acceptably.

Copy the .service files generated by this script to /usr/local/etc/avahi/services (FreeBSD)
or /etc/avahi/services (Linux).

Then restart both avahi and cups with a user with superuser privileges:

    sudo service avahi-daemon restart
    sudo service cupsd restart

**Python Requirements:**
This script depends on the python-cups library, and optionally python-lxml to make pretty xml files. 

FreeBSD:

    sudo pkg install print/py-pycups devel/py-lxml net/py-avahi devel/py-gobject3

Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install python3-cups python3-lxml 

CentOS:

    sudo yum install system-config-printer-libs

### Usage: airprint-generate.py [options]

```
Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --dnssd           Search for network printers using DNS-SD (requires
                        avahi)
  -D DNSDOMAIN, --dnsdomain=DNSDOMAIN
                        DNS domain where printers are located.
  -c, --cups            Search CUPS for shared printers (requires CUPS)
  -t, --tls-version     Generate a file for secure printing using the
                        specified TLS version (e.g. -t 1.2)
  -H HOSTNAME, --host=HOSTNAME
                        Hostname of CUPS server (optional)
  -P PORT, --port=PORT  Port number of CUPS server
  -u USER, --user=USER  Username to authenticate with against CUPS
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory=DIRECTORY
                        Directory to create service files
  -v, --verbose         Print debugging information to STDERR
  -p PREFIX, --prefix=PREFIX
                        Prefix all files with this string
  -a, --admin           Include the printer specified URI as the adminurl
```

## Docker containerized avahi .service generation

After the printers have been configured in the cups server, docker can interactively generate the avahi .service
while making use of the container.

* Build the container

```shell
docker build -t airprint-generate .
```

* Generate the avahi service by defining the ip address of the cups server

```shell
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/tmp airprint-generate -c -H ${CUPS_SERVER_IP} -d /tmp
```
